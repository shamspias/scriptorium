# 🏛️ Scriptorium

A handpicked collection of scripts, tools, and utilities I rely on for data science, machine learning, and automation tasks.

> This is where my most useful code ends up — built, refined, and reused.

## 🧰 What’s Inside

* 📂 `tools/`

  * `dataset/` – Handy dataset utilities (like YOLO splitters)

## 🧠 Why “Scriptorium”?

> A scriptorium was a place where monks copied and preserved knowledge by hand.
> This is my version — but for code that actually gets used.
